Pool size - 660,430 Gallons of water can be held in the swimming pool, during opening hours - the pool is always full
Assume that when adding chlorine to the swimming pool, it has no effect on how full the pool is
Also assume that the swimming pool is drained after closing every day
First part of the input is the opening hours of the swimming pool during the week, these never change
Second part of the input is how many people, divided into adults and children, swam each day of the previous year

Last year you opened a swimming pool - as you are new to running a swimming pool, you guessed the amount of chlorine
would need to be added in order to keep it safe for your guests and everything seemed to be fine, but the problem is:
it's costing quite a bit to maintain, and you've decided to optimise the amount you use to lower the cost.

Part 1:
Given that your current brand of chlorine takes 1,000 gallons of water for every 1 gallon of chlorine per hour to be considered
safe, and the opening hours specified at the top of the input: 
what is the minimum amount of chlorine required to the nearest gallon by the pool in 1 full 7 day week for the pool 
to be considered safe?

Answer: 38338

Part 2:
Now that you've figured out the amount of chlorine required, you need to find the cost, the pricing is
calculated as follows:

you can bulk order 10,000 gallons of chlorine for £800
normal price per gallon is £1 per gallon 10 gallons

Using as many of the bulk orders as you can to reduce the overall cost, what is the minimum cost you can pay per week
for the amount of chlorine required in part 1, rounding up to the nearest 10 gallons?

Answer: £3234

Part 3:
Now that you've worked out the chlorine cost for a week, you need to extrapolate this data for 2021 (Starting on Friday 1st)
to find out the total cost for the year so that you can work out your total outgoings for a year

You can bulk order chlorine a full year in advance, the following can apply for bigger bulk orders:

1,000,000 gallons of chlorine for £70,000

Given the new offer that applies alongside the other offer above, 
what is the total cost of the chlorine for the year 2021?

Answer: £142592

Part 4:
Now you've established your outgoings for the chlorine for the year 2021, you need to calculate your profit, and to do so you've decided
to use last years records of customers to calculate the total income for this year. In the input file provided, 
the second part of the input shows how many people attended last year, split into adults and children. Adults pay an
entry fee of £10 for a day, whereas the fee for children is £7 for a day. Given this information, and using the input
provided, calculate the total income from the customers for last year minus the total chlorine cost for a year (total profit)

Answer: £858157
